Hello!, my name is Abel Do√±ate, I am currently studying Mathematics and Engineering Physics at Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC).

My main interests are mathematics, music theory and thinking about useless stuff (the judgment of whether the first two are contained in the third is left to the reader). This webpage will be a reflection of that (sorry in advance).

I apologise for the fact that the photo on the banner has not been taken by me on a hiking journey, like on every respectable mathematician's page. I promise the picture is in process.

Find my CV <a href="CV.pdf" target="blank">here</a>.
