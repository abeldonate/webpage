I make my class notes with Vim in LaTeX using the extensions vim-tex and UltiSnip.

All the work here have been taken from Gilles Castel [here](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/), who has documented all the process of improving his workflow with latex and vim insanely well.

**vimtex**
***
vim-tex is an extension for vim that allows you to compile and render a .pdf file from a .tex in vim.

**UltiSnip**
***
UltiSnip is a vim extension that manages snippets. Snippets are not only used for tex, but I find them incredibly useful when writing .tex files, as allows you to store repetitive and tedious patterns in a few keys. With a good structure of these snippets is possible even write faster than by hand.

**Inkscape**
***
I create the figures in my .tex files using Inkscape. Shortcuts for improving the workflow in Inkscape are available in Gilles Castell's [webpage](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-2/)
